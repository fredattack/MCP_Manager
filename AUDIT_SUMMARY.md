# UX/IA Audit Summary - MCP Manager
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Audit Type:** Static Code Analysis
**Application:** MCP Manager (Laravel 12 + React 19 + Inertia.js)
**Auditor:** Claude Code (UX/IA Specialist)

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive UX/IA audit conducted via static code analysis of navigation architecture, accessibility patterns, performance characteristics, and user flow design. **CRITICAL FINDING:** Application implementation does not match PRD expectations. PRD describes a "Git repository manager with AI workflow automation," but the codebase implements an "MCP integration manager" with no repository or workflow features.

### Top 5 Critical Issues

1. **PRD-Codebase Mismatch (P0 Blocker)**
   - Expected: `/repositories`, `/workflows/:id`, repository connection flow
   - Found: MCP integration manager with Notion, Todoist, Gmail, Calendar, JIRA integrations
   - Impact: Core product identity unclear, MVP goals unachievable with current codebase

2. **Language Inconsistency in Navigation (P0)**
   - "Commandes Naturelles" is French while all other nav items are English
   - Signals incomplete i18n or rushed development
   - Quick fix: 2-minute label change to "Natural Language"

3. **Technical Debt Exposed in UI (P0)**
   - "Integrations (Old)" label exposes internal migration to users
   - Duplicate JIRA entries (/jira and /integrations/jira) confuse IA
   - Quick fix: 5-minute cleanup of navigation items

4. **Accessibility Violations (P1)**
   - Integration status badges use color-only indicators (WCAG 1.4.1 violation)
   - 2x2px colored dots invisible to screen readers and users with motor impairments
   - No text labels or aria-labels on status indicators
   - Quick fix: 10-minute addition of aria-labels and tooltips

5. **Unclear Dashboard Hierarchy (P1)**
   - Two dashboards: "Dashboard" and "MCP Dashboard" with undefined purposes
   - Users confused about when to use which dashboard
   - Requires product decision: merge or clearly differentiate

### Top 5 Recommendations

1. **NAV-01: Remove Technical Debt from UI (5 min, High Impact)**
   - Remove "(Old)" suffix from "Integrations (Old)" nav item
   - Either complete migration or hide deprecated page entirely
   - Acceptance: No user-facing labels contain "(Old)" or similar technical indicators

2. **NAV-02: Fix Language Consistency (2 min, High Impact)**
   - Change "Commandes Naturelles" to "Natural Language" or "AI Commands"
   - Implement i18n system if multilingual support is roadmap item
   - Acceptance: All navigation labels use consistent language

3. **A11Y-01: Add Status Badge Labels (10 min, High Impact)**
   - Add aria-label to integration status badges: "Connected", "Disconnected", "Error"
   - Add tooltip on hover showing text status
   - Consider icon shapes (checkmark, x, warning) in addition to color
   - Acceptance: Screen readers announce status, color-blind users can distinguish states

4. **UX-01: Add Onboarding CTA to Dashboard (30 min, High Impact)**
   - Replace placeholder patterns with clear "Connect Your First Integration" CTA for new users
   - Show summary cards for users with existing integrations
   - Acceptance: New users have clear first action within dashboard

5. **CRITICAL-01: Align PRD with Implementation (L effort, P0)**
   - **Option A:** Implement missing Git features (/repositories, /workflows/:id, OAuth flows)
   - **Option B:** Update PRD to reflect MCP integration manager as core product
   - Acceptance: Stakeholder decision documented, single source of truth established

## Navigation Depth Analysis

| Route | Clicks from Dashboard | Clicks from Home (/) | Group |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| /dashboard | 0 | 1 | Main |
| /mcp/dashboard | 1 | 2 | Main |
| /mcp/server/config | 1 | 2 | Main |
| /integrations/manager | 1 | 2 | Main |
| /integrations | 1 | 2 | Main |
| /notion | 1 | 2 | Main |
| /jira | 1 | 2 | Main |
| /integrations/todoist | 1 | 2 | Integrations |
| /gmail | 1 | 2 | Integrations |
| /calendar | 1 | 2 | Integrations |
| /settings/profile | 2 | 3 | Settings |

**Key Finding:** All primary pages are within 1 click from dashboard (good), but expected `/repositories` route does not exist.

## Accessibility Audit Summary

### Strengths
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Cmd/Ctrl+B sidebar toggle implemented
- **Focus Management:** TooltipProvider with proper focus states
- **Screen Reader Support:** sr-only classes on Sheet headers, ARIA labels on toggle buttons
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile Sheet vs. desktop collapsible sidebar
- **Semantic HTML:** `<main>` for content, `<header>` for app header

### Critical Issues
- **Color-Only Status Indicators:** Integration badges violate WCAG 1.4.1
- **Missing NAV Landmark:** Sidebar lacks `<nav>` role for screen reader navigation
- **External Link Security:** Footer links lack `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and visual indicators
- **Icon-Only Navigation:** Some icons may need explicit aria-labels (requires live testing)

### Compliance Score (Estimated)
- **WCAG 2.1 Level A:** ~85% (color-only violations block full compliance)
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA:** ~70% (contrast ratios not verified without live testing)

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Positive Patterns
- **Code Splitting:** Inertia.js automatic per-page splitting
- **Prefetching:** All nav links use `prefetch` attribute for hover-based preloading
- **State Persistence:** Sidebar state in cookie (7-day max-age) prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Conditional Rendering:** `useIsMobile` hook prevents desktop code execution on mobile

### Potential Bottlenecks
- **Icon Bundle Size:** 18 Lucide icons imported in app-sidebar.tsx alone (~30-50KB)
- **CLS Risk:** PlaceholderPattern SVG on dashboard may shift during load
- **No Loading States:** SidebarMenuSkeleton exists but not visibly used
- **Missing Progress Indicators:** Inertia navigation lacks visible loading feedback

### Estimated Metrics (Proxy - Requires Live Testing)
- **TTI (Time to Interactive):** ~800-1200ms (typical Inertia + React SSR)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Dashboard placeholder pattern (risk of delay)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** <0.1 expected (sidebar animations controlled)

## Recommended Audit Follow-Up

This static code audit provides strong heuristic findings but cannot replace live browser testing. Recommend follow-up activities:

1. **Live Accessibility Scan (1 hour)**
   - Run axe-core on all pages
   - Verify color contrast ratios (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for text)
   - Test keyboard navigation flow end-to-end
   - Verify focus indicators and tab order

2. **Performance Testing (1 hour)**
   - Measure actual TTI, LCP, CLS with Lighthouse
   - Test on throttled network (Slow 3G simulation)
   - Analyze bundle sizes with Vite build analysis
   - Verify Inertia prefetch cache behavior

3. **User Flow Testing (2 hours)**
   - Onboarding flow: Login → Dashboard → First integration setup
   - Integration management: Connect, test, disconnect flows
   - Error scenarios: Middleware failures, API errors, network failures
   - Mobile responsive behavior at 390px, 768px, 1024px breakpoints

4. **Stakeholder Workshop (2 hours)**
   - Resolve PRD-codebase mismatch
   - Define MVP scope and timeline
   - Prioritize Git features vs. MCP integrations
   - Establish product vision and roadmap

1. Implement missing onboarding CTA (UX-01)
2. Resolve dashboard hierarchy confusion (NAV-04)
3. Either build Git features OR update PRD to reflect MCP focus
4. Complete Tier 2 improvements for production-ready polish

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] All P0 issues resolved before production launch
