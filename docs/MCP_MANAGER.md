# MCP Manager â€“ Technical Overview & Purpose

## Purpose

The MCP Manager is a web-based application intended to provide users with a visual and structured interface to interact with the capabilities offered by the MCP Server. It allows users to initiate, monitor, and explore workflows involving Notion content and LLMs from a clean, responsive dashboard.

## Responsibilities

- Act as the user-facing frontend to manage and interact with the MCP Server.
- Provide an authenticated space where users can trigger actions (e.g., fetch Notion pages, summarize content, submit prompts).
- Route all business logic requests through an API that communicates with the MCP Server.
- Display results returned from the MCP Server in a structured and human-readable format.
- Serve as the orchestration layer between frontend inputs and MCP logic.

## Principles

- **Two-layered architecture**:
    - Laravel backend (API layer, service orchestration, secure routing).
    - React frontend (dashboard, user inputs, display layer).
- **One-way responsibility**: The manager never executes logic itself; it delegates all functional processing to the MCP Server.
- **Environment configuration**: MCP Server URL, API keys, and optional features are defined in environment configuration files.
- **Modular UI components**: Each view (e.g., "Notion Pages", "Prompt History") should be isolated for clarity and reusability.
- **REST-first interactions**: All communications with the MCP Server are made over RESTful APIs.
- **Reactive and responsive**: The UI should adapt fluidly and provide feedback (loading states, error handling, success states).
- **Open to extension**: Ready to support additional MCP features like scheduling, workflows, file processing, etc.
- **Separation of display and orchestration**: Display logic is React; orchestration is in Laravel controllers/services.

## Long-Term Goals (optional)

- Multi-user support with roles and permission levels.
- Historical logging of all interactions with MCP Server.
- Template library of LLM prompts and workflows.
- Notification and alert system for scheduled tasks or long-running processes.
